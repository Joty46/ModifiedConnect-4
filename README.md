# Connect4_Modifed_Version
This is a modified version of connect4, where squares are matched instead of line. Normally connect-4 is one kind of game between two players where each of them tries to make a line using four consecutive same color balls. But in our game it will try to make a square using  four same colors balls.
It is a two players game.
* One player is the user.
* Another is AI.

The game is designed in python. We used minimax algorithm and alpha-beta pruning for designing.


The full game demonstration is given below:
